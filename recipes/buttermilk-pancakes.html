		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Haven't ever tried homemade pancakes? You should. They are easy to make and the whole family will love
			them. As everyone knows, nothing can beat a home cooked breakfast.</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Flour</li>
			<li>Sugar</li>
			<li>Leaveners (baking powder, baking soda)</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Buttermilk</li>
			<li>Milk</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
			<li>Butter</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
				Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl.
				Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
			<li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
				You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
			<li> Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's 
				just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
			<li> Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake.
				Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until 
				browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
			<li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
		</ol>
