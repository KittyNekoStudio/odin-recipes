# odin-recipes
The recipes project from The Odin Project.

I haven't learned much, but I did synthesize what I've been learning so far. So while I didn't really learn anything
new I did learn how it all fits together. Which is just as important as learning new ideas. After all, if you
can't produce anything what was this all even for.
